# Sentiment-Analysis-Bitcoin

This program plots bitcoin price over 2021, as well as positive/negative/neutral tweet totals per hour for a 
more limited time period. It also generates a simple overall wordcloud for that time period, as well as sentiment-specific wordclouds for each type of tweet (positive/negative/neutral), all while omitting certain common cryptocurrency-related words such as crypto,usd,eth,etc...
Can be used to visually demonstrate correlations between tweet volume and large price fluctuations, as well as fluctuations in sentiment-specific tweet percentages.
